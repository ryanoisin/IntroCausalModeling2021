# Introduction to Causal Modeling
A repository for the workshop "Introduction to Causal Modeling". The workshop consists of `lecture` and `hands-on` parts. 

Participants are asked to run `setup.R` **before the start of the workshop** in order to install all of the packages which will be used in the hands-on part.
